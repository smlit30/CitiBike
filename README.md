# RESULTS

From Viz 1 & 2 we can tell a majority of the trips taken are less than one hour with the bulk of those being less than 10 minutes.  This is

From Viz 3 & 4 the charts show that most rides are taken during rush hours around 8am and 5pm. We could assume here that most people are renting bikes to go to and from work but that would be an assumption and not directly inferred from this data visualization.  We could take a look more at locations and work offices to learn more about that.

From Viz 5 we can see that most users are subscribers.  


# SUMMARY

From these visuzations the company can make decisions on when to make repairs on bikes, what times would impact customers the least and see what they can offer subscribers to encourage more of the general user base to subscribe.
